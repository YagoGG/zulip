    # "multiple spaces before operator"
    # There are several typos here, but also several instances that are
    # being used for alignment in dict keys/values using the `dict`
    # constructor. We could fix the alignment cases by switching to the `{}`
    # constructor, but it makes fixing this rule a little less
    # straightforward.
    E221,

    # "missing whitespace around arithmetic operator"
    # This should possibly be cleaned up, though changing some of
    # these may make the code less readable.
    E226,

    # "unexpected spaces around keyword / parameter equals"
    # Many of these should be fixed, but many are also being used for
    # alignment/making the code easier to read.
    E251,

    # "at least two spaces before inline comment"
    # This we should probably clean up, but has 800+ instances in
    # conflict (many of them type comments), so fixing this will
    # be a lot of churn.
    E261,

    # "block comment should start with '#'"
    # These serve to show which lines should be changed in files customized
    # by the user. We could probably resolve one of E265 or E266 by
    # standardizing on a single style for lines that the user might want to
    # change.
    E265,

    # "too many leading '#' for block comment"
    # Most of these are there for valid reasons.
    E266,

    # "expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition"
    # Zulip only uses 1 blank line after class/function
    # definitions; the PEP-8 recommendation results in super sparse code.
    E302, E305,

    # "module level import not at top of file"
    # Most of these are there for valid reasons, though there might be a
    # few that could be eliminated.
    E402,

    # "line too long"
    # Zulip is a bit less strict about line length, and has its
    # own check for this (see max_length)

    # "do not assign a lambda expression, use a def"
    # Fixing these would probably reduce readability in most cases.
